My name is Tim Walsh. I am a digital preservationist and software developer based in Montreal. I work as the Digital Preservation Librarian at [Concordia University](https://concordia.ca).

Prior to joining Concordia University Library, I was a 2018 Summer Fellow at the [Library Innovation Lab at Harvard University](https://lil.law.harvard.edu). Between 2015-2018 I planned and implemented a 5 FTE digital preservation program as the Digital Archivist at the [Canadian Centre for Architecture](https://cca.qc.ca). While working on my MS in Library and Information Science from [Simmons University](https://www.simmons.edu/) (then Simmons College) in Boston, I was lucky enough to work and be mentored in archives and/or digital preservation at [Harvard Business School Historical Collections](https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/baker-business), [Tufts University Digital Collections and Archives](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/), and the University of Wyoming's [American Heritage Center](http://www.uwyo.edu/ahc/). I am a recipient of a [2019 NDSA Individual Innovation Award](https://ndsa.org/2019/10/16/ndsa-announces-winners-of-2019-innovation-awards.html).

I am also a software developer with experience building command-line, GUI, and web applications using technologies like Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, PyQt5, JavaScript, and Vue.js. I am a strong believer in free and open source software (FOSS) and am the developer/maintainer of several FOSS digital preservation software utilities.

Some of my areas of interest and expertise include:

* Digital architecture and design records
* Management of sensitive information in digital archives
* Environmental sustainability of digital preservation
* Digital preservation repository system planning and design
* Archivematica
* BitCurator
* Digital forensics and digital processing workflows
* Scripting and automation
* Web archiving
