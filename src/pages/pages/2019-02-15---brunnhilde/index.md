## Brunnhilde

A Python command-line and GUI reporting tool for directories and disk images. Brunnhilde bundles tools such as [Siegfried](https://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried), [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/), [bulk_extractor](https://forensicswiki.org/wiki/Bulk_extractor), The Sleuthkit (TSK)'s [tsk\_recover](https://sleuthkit.org/sleuthkit/man/tsk_recover.html), [HFS Explorer](http://www.catacombae.org/hfsexplorer/), and [fiwalk](https://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Fiwalk) to streamline appraisal and minimal processing of digital archives.

Brunnhilde was written to supplement existing file format identification and characterization tools, with a focus on producing human-readable high-level reports for digital archives and digital preservation practitioners. It is installed as a standard utility in the [BitCurator](https://wiki.bitcurator.net/index.php?title=BitCurator_Environment) environment.
